# Code Review

1. Very good and clean structure. Functions, components etc.
2. Cool concept! Fun game to practice your memory!
3. Preload scene looks very good and suits the theme perfectly!
4. 'hasPoint.js 19-26' remember to remove comments.
5. Incredibly impressive work on 'levels.js'.
6. There is a small delay when the player jumps on the keys and the key pushes down. Does not always trigger.
7. (Very small note) The low gravity can be annoying after a while :D
8. On rare occasion Mozart fall half-way through a key.
9. Possible to fail the level after 'correct', if player triggers another key quickly afterwards.
10. Overall, very difficult to make a review on this project, since it was top notch! Well done!
